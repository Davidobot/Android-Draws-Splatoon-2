# Splatoon 2 Drawings via Android
Kind of like https://github.com/WyseNynja/Splatoon-2-Drawing but without any USB.

Emulates a procon on Android using BLE. Can/will probably serve as a base for implementing an open-source alternative to [JoyCon Droid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rdapps.gamepad).

For structure, will mimick this wonderful repo https://github.com/mart1nro/joycontrol

Made for fun and educational purposes.
